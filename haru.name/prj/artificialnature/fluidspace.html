<h1>Fluid Space</h1>
<p><strong>Artificial Nature: Fluid Space </strong>opened on May 01 2009 at <a href="http://somamuseum.org/english/" target="_blank">SOMA</a> (Seoul Olympic Museum of Art) as part of the <a href="http://www.nabi.or.kr/alicemuseum" target="_blank">A.L.I.C.E. MUSEUM 2009</a>, Seoul, Korea. The<em> A.L.I.C.E. Museum 2009</em> is organized by <a href="http://eng.nabi.or.kr/" target="_blank">Art Center Nabi</a>. It consists of creative perception, learning, and action for Artistic, Lively, Intelligent, Creative, and Eco-friendly Kids. Artificial Nature is exhibited under the category 'Creative action &ndash; ecology &amp; cosmic vision.' The exhibition runs from May 01 to June 21, 2009. </p>

<p><strong>Artificial Nature: Fluid Space</strong> upgrades several components of Artificial Nature as an Infinite Game:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The fluid dynamics of the environment are much improved (deriving from: J. Stam. Real-time fluid dynamics for games. Proceedings of the Game Developer <br />
    Conference, Jan 2003.) All objects are affected by (and affect) fluid flow to varying degrees, including the navigating user herself.</li>
  <li>A camera and microphone in the exhibition space detect user movements and sounds, and add turbulence to the fluid simulation accordingly.</li>
  <li>The space of the environment is infiinte (toroidal); there are no boundaries to limit exploration.</li>
  <li>Organism development is visualized continuously, growing from smaller spherical objects into larger, spikier objects.</li>
  <li>Secondary biotic organisms have branching rather than linear structures.</li>
  <li>Particles follow a law of conservation through a circular life-cycle in the ecosystem. It is possible to observe the particles throughout this cycle:
    <ol>
        <li>Mobile organisms eat orange particles, they are gradually metabolized within the organism and expelled when fully metabolized or upon organism death.</li>
      <li>Expelled particles are purple, but gradually accrue energy from the environment and become blue. Purple/blue particles move quickly in the fluid but do not clump.</li>
      <li>Branchlike organisms absorb nearby blue particles and extract energy. The particles diffuse through the branches to their tips, and are ejected as yellow particles.</li>
      <li>Yellow particles gradually accrue energy from the environment and become orange. Yellow/orange particles move slowly in the fluid and tend to clump together.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Three events are sonified and spatialized in the exhibition space:
    <ol>
      <li>Organisms eat particles (short duration granular sound)</li>
      <li>Organisms reproduce (fixed pitch metallic/flute-like sound)</li>
      <li>Organisms encounter each other (variable pitch softer sound)</li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  </ol>
