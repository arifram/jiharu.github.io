<h1>Artificial Nature  </h1>
<p><strong>Artificial Nature</strong> is a research project and an evolving art installation by Haru Ji and Graham Wakefield.</p>
<p>You may remember experiences from your childhood, such as playing with
  your fingers in the flow of a river, or in the path of small marching
  insects, to alter their emerging patterns. Such play is a direct
  interaction with complex systems, provoking deep insights and
  aesthetically fascinating natural patterns; ludic investigations that may be
  considered an infinite game*. </p>
<p>We approach this subject through a trans-disciplinary research project drawing upon bio-inspired system theories and the aesthetics of computational world-making, incorporating the development of engaging immersive 
  ecosystems as art installations. Our motivation is 
  to develop a deeper understanding of emergence and creativity as a form of art, 
  study and play, by taking inspiration from nature&rsquo;s creativity while recognizing the potential of natural creation beyond the known and the physical. </p>
<p>As an exhibited installation, Artificial Nature has taken on two versions so far (click links for more information and videos):</p>
