<h1>Research</h1>
<p><strong>Artificial Nature </strong> is a transdisciplinary research project of creativity in complex systems: in particular we are investigating  the aesthetics of  world-making through the computational embodiment of generative ecosystems. Our motivation is to develop a deeper understanding of emergence and creativity as a form of art, study and play, by taking inspiration from nature's creativity but recognizing the potential of natural creation beyond the physical. </p>

<h2>Development</h2>
<p>Christopher Langton[10] coined the phrase <i>life-as-it-could-be</i> to characterize the 
field of Artificial Life as an investigation into the nature of life in general, not 
restricted to our unique local example. The question of lifelikeness, which lies 
at the heart of Artificial Life research, has aesthetic as well as epistemological 
implications. Jon McCormack [12] paraphrases life-as-it-could-be into <i>art-as-it-could-be</i>: an exploration of generative creativity not bounded by existent notions 
of creativity, aesthetics or artist. </p>
<p>The suffix <i>-as-it-could-be</i> indicates a shift in thought from the actual to the 
possible, a shift in thinking beyond the immediately apparent to the speculatively  
imaginable. This mode of thought has always had a vital role, both in our cultural 
development and in our individual learning processes [15]. Computation offers 
the potential to explore the possible with unprecedented independence of our 
limits of imagination: to reveal the world in ways that only automated technology 
can. It is for this reason that bio-inspired computational models are so appealing 
for creative research. </p>
<h5>Tools, models and worlds. </h5>
<p>Etxeberria[7] identifies three distinct perspectives in ALife pro jects: towards 
the development of problem-solving tools, towards the generation of theoretical 
models, and the creation of speculative instantiations (or worlds). Aesthetically 
motivated examples of the first perspective are easy to find in the literature. 
McCormack [11] notes that computational creative discovery may be employed 
in the arts to assist human creativity or produce autonomously creative systems. 
In either case, bio-inspired systems are used as means to achieve creative results 
(images, sounds) unattainable by existing methods. Our goal however is different. 
Rather than using our understanding of nature‘s capability to create for the 
purposes of finished works, i.e. bio-inspired tools, our pro ject aims to extend 
the sense of exploratory play, immersion and wonder that nature is capable of 
inspiring. </p>
<p>The question of the <i>lifelike</i> is what distinguishes the second and third of 
Exteberria’s perspectives. The production of theoretical models aims to extend 
our understanding of the referent phenomena (life) and therefore has strong 
dependency upon actuality, while the criterion in the production of speculative 
instantiations is more intuitively defined (lifelike). Models are ultimately valued 
by their capacity to produce verifiable predictive theories. Instantiations have a 
more diffuse boundary between the natural and artificial, and thus indicate a 
more exploratory potential: </p>
<blockquote>“Because they do not have a concrete empirical referent, their value 
resides in their being new creations of ontology that, although inspired
by natural phenomena, provide as an end result something different from 
life on Earth, but with a strong lifelikeness... the most radical ways of 
exploring life-as-it-could-be.” [7] </blockquote>
<h5>The computational sublime. </h5>
<p>As such, instantiations as aesthetic ob jects offer a clearer path to engender an 
experience of the computationally sublime[12]: the sensory experience of the vast 
creative potential of computation unfettered by teleological purpose. Instantiations, as inspirational lifelike worlds, may draw out the the potential sublime 
latent in our interactive engagement with the virtual computational field. 
This understanding founds our creative research through the art of bio-inspired immsersive, exploratory worlds. Although bio-inspired mechanisms are 
the means, they do not supply the ends. Our goal is not to make the processes 
formally clear: the process is in service of the aesthetic. We hope to resolve 
the apparent tension in the conjunction of <i>nature</i> with <i>artificial</i>, the realization 
of creative <i>physis</i> through extended <i>poiesis</i>, by means of immersive aesthetic 
experiences within such worlds. </p>
<p>We can thus divide our pro ject into a twofold demand: the construction of a 
world engendering emergent structures, and the design of an immersive mode of 
involvement in this world. The following sections describe our progress in these 
aspects respectively. </p>

<h3>World-building</h3>

<h6>Given a blank slate of computation, how do you create an immersive, emergent 
world?</h6>
<p>A fundamental requirement of a world with creative potential is that it engender emergent structures and behaviors. A second and equally critical requirement is that it be realizable (computable). These minimal requirements ensure 
novelty, but not necessarily immersion. To that end, we employ a strategy of 
<i>embodiment</i> rather than <i>representation</i>. Every structural observable must have 
a systemic function within the world. Furthermore, a genealogical account must 
be given as to how every structure and function emerges from the basic initial elements (and how it disappears). Embodiment offers a means to preserve a sense 
of coherent materiality despite the requirement of unpredictable emergence. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ecosystem has been identified as a productive metaphor and mechanism for the generation of creativity without explicit teleology [5, 6]. Ecosystemic models have been shown to be domain-generic, with applications accross 
many different areas of study incuding ecology, economics, social sciences. The 
ecosystem also offers clear integrations with other complex systems models [8], 
providing a suitable overall template to be filled in with particularized models. 
Our approach has been to prototype many of these models in reduced computational forms rather like artistic studies (Fig. 2). The insights, heuristics and algorithms we glean from these prototypes may gradually develop into a composite whole. Ultimately the aim is not to create an aggregate of distinct models, 
but to produce a single model with potential for many different kinds of creative 
development. </p>
<p>We can overcome the incommensurability of specific models by drawing upon 
more abstract results of bio-inspired philosophy. Excellent examples are Manuel 
De Landa’s readings of Bergson and Deleuze [3, 4], describing a progressive differentiation of an intensive virtuality into the multiply stratified (as opposed to 
the assembly of distinct types), emphasizing the importance of developmental 
or genealogical accounts as to how phenomena, qualities and stabilities emerge. 
Fortunately the <i>-as-it-could-be</i> stance raises an important distinction of motivation between scientific simulation and Artificial Nature: our constraints may be 
more flexible, and our mode of validation is aesthetic. </p> 
<h5>Inanimate field </h5>
<p>It has been well demonstrated that relatively simple systems comprising a handful of formal primitives, rules of interaction and spatiotemporal distributions can 
produce an astonishing range of unpredictable patterns and behaviors. 
Thermodynamic theory for example suggests a conservation of matter-energy 
but a continuous decay of structure by entropy in every transaction. Prigogine 
[13] demonstrated that the introduction of a source of matter-energy flow can 
push a system far from equilibrium and trigger the self-organization of <i>dissipative structures</i>. We take this model as our starting point in the production 
of a creative world. This readily simulable model is encouraging for a computationally based creative world. Our ecosystem begins with a spatial field of 
pseudo-chemical elements, concentrations or morphogens (represented as RGB 
colors) along with simple diffusion-reaction rules. </p>
<p>Though early prototypes worked with a 2D or 2.5D field for simplicity, the 
exhibited work employs a fully three-dimensional field. The biggest challenge 
in the move to three dimensions was not computation but representation; standard field-visualization techniques such as isosurfaces or volume-rendering were
deemed to visually obstructive to an immersive experience. We also explored 
tree-like or rhizomatic structures as more open landscapes through a 3D space. 
Our final choice however was the use of mobile particles (as accessible coagulations of elements) within a fluid-like environment. Particles have multiple 
advantages: they can display not only type but also density, with regions of concentration and regions of absence, and furthermore they can indicate vector flow 
within a liquid medium by their aggregate movements. </p>

Fig. 3. Animate agents in Artificial Nature form the connective tissue between the 
various domains and interactions in the ecosystem as a whole. </p>
<h5>Animate field </h5>
<p>The self-organizing substrate provides the building blocks of biological strata; 
diverting matter-energy on its path to its inevitable entropic decay through 
processes of transformation and retention, <i>tweaking the conceptual space</i> of the 
physical world in order to generate structure. The biosphere introduces apparent 
autonomy as it adapts and develops more elaborate capability to control the 
environment around it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, models for how the animate emerges from the inanimate are 
less well defined. In the current implementation of Artificial Nature we introduce 
autonomy artificially in the form of spatially situated concurrent processes. 
Modeling animacy within an environment can however draw upon extensive 
research in Multi-Agent Systems, Agent- or Individual-Based Modeling. Agents 
may drift in the flow of the enclosing environment, and may also use stored 
energy to trigger autonomously directed movement. Due to the entropic order 
of the world, agents must constantly exchange elements with their local field in 
order to gain energy for growth and behavior, and discharge toxic waste. This 
metabolic process may eventually become fully autopoietic. Since agents may fail 
to exchange matter-energy sufficiently they may die. In order that communities 
survive, an organism with sufficient energy storage is granted the capability to 
reproduce by binary fission.</p> 
<p>We also draw upon systems approaches to understanding the processes by 
which biotic matter forms, to shape how undifferenciated points of autonomy 
develop into differenciated, constrained organisms, tying form and function (micro and macro) with an in-time account of their mutual emergence [9]. Agents 
contain virtual genes, hierarchical expressions which, rather than specifying results explicitly, are gradually evaluated to guide development and behavior. An 
account of how the virtual genes emerge from the prebiotic soup is currently 
outstanding. </p>
<p>The genes themselves evolve independently of reproduction through lateral 
gene transfer with other agents in close proximity. Selective pressures upon the 
gene-pool emerge through the complex feedback between gene expression, organism behavior and environmental conditions (Fig. 3). </p>
<h5>Behavioral field </h5>
<p>Agent behavior may include movement, growth, chemical exchange, reproduction, perception and self-control. Mapping between perceptual stimulus, internal 
need and action develops according to an adaptive neural network. 
Agents may perceive and act upon internal and environmental properties, but 
also emit and listen to local sonic signals. Though the use of sound is significant 
to us observers, it is clearly the marking of an existent field with agent information, just as territorial scents may be in an olfactory domain. In our current 
iteration, sonic signals display the presence of nutrients and more importantly 
organisms may sing their genome, and adopt the genome of a song heard, thus 
genetic exchange occurs aurally (and with imperfections). This a priori mapping 
of sound to behavior is planned to be replaced by a generic mechanism capable of 
supporting self-organized social behaviors. In the long term, an account must be 
made as to how these various functions arise in an agents body, just an account 
must also be made as to how agents themselves originate in the environmental 
field.</p>
<h5>Development platform </h5>
<p>Early versions have been prototyped using <a href="http://www.cycling74.com">Max/MSP/Jitter</a>, while the current system is implemented using the <a href="http://lua-av.mat.ucsb.edu/">LuaAV</a> software framework. LuaAV supported the rapid development of an interactive, audiovisual virtual world, while the embedded language <a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua</a> is naturally suited to real-time simulation because of its extensible, dynamic nature and efficient garbage collection.</p>
