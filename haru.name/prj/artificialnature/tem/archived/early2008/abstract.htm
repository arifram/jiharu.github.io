    <h3>Abstract: Creativity as an Infinite Game </h3>
    <p><img src="img/inspiration.jpg" width="710" height="102"></p>
    <p>You may remember experiences from your childhood, such as playing with
        your fingers in the flow of a river, or in the path of small marching
        insects, to alter their emerging patterns. Such play is a direct
        interaction with complex systems, provoking deep insights and
        aesthetically fascinating natural patterns; ludic investigation may be
        considered as an infinite game. We approach this subject as 
        cross-disciplinary research through the development of a media-art
        project: &quot;Artificial Nature&quot;.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><img src="img/interface-series.jpg" width="710" height="100"></p>
    <p> The project is an audio-visual art installation bringing forth a world of
        aesthetic play through the embodiment of complex multi-layered and
        inter-modulating systems. The installation consists of a projection of a
        virtual world, with touch-screen and additional sensor interfaces. The
        virtual world is a visualization of information flow in open dynamical
        and dissipative systems, interweaving geological, physico-chemical and
        biological strata. Within this world, evolutionary developmental
        (&lsquo;evo-devo&rsquo;) growth is modeled to evoke truly autopoietic virtual
        lifeforms. Spectators can witness, control and create beautiful, complex
        and generative patterns evolving from the behaviors of the species, as
        the organisms in turn interact with their open dynamic environment. As a
        spectator gives his/her inputs through the touch screen or other sensors,
        he/she may change local fields of the environment, landscape or physical
        laws, and actively observe how the feedback systems produce new
        behavioral patterns.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><img src="img/evo_texture_series.jpg" width="710" height="100"></p>    <p> As an endlessly generative system of abstract images and sound, the locus
        of artistic authorship is not easy to place (the artist, the participant,
        the system?); we consider this but one aspect of its nature as an
        infinite game. Our presentation explores the numerous layers of this
        notion in the embodied art project, discussing its ludic features and
    artistic, technical and philosophical potentials.</p></td>
