    <h3>Concepts: Creativity in Nature, Creativity in Culture </h3>
    <p>Interwoven research of cross-disciplinary nodes: </p>
    <p><img src="img/nodes.jpg" width="535" height="663"></p>
    <h3>Temporal composition as creative evolution </h3>
    <p>The theoretical body behind the project is  inspired by Bergson's creative evolution, and its extensions through Deleuze and De Landa,  the strand of complex feedback theories from Wiener's cybernetics through complexity theory to Maturana/Varela's Autopoiesis, and also referencing the temporal theories of electro-acoustic composers such as Xenakis, Stockhausen, Brun.</p>
    <p>The desired virutal world is an ecosystem constructed of three principal strata:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Geographical (a field of terrain / weather / etc)<br>
        </li>
      <li>Biological (evolving species)</li>
      <li>Communicative (sonic memes between organisms)<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    <p>We are particularly interested in experimenting with complex levels of feedback between these strata. For example, we might cause the activity of species to rapidly and directly transform the terrain, or experimenting with allowing memes to influence genes.</p>
    <h4>Ecosystem, as a system</h4>
    <p>The natural order of the physical world is thermodynamic, which from a system perspective implies a conservation of matter-energy, but a continuous decay of structure by entropy in every matter-energy transaction. An ecosystem however involves an influx of thermodynamic energy (predominantly from the sun), a flow source capable of pushing a system far from equilibrium.</p>
    <p>This 'free' energy source is diverted by the biological strata on its path to its inevitable entropic decay, through multi-layered complexes of processes of transformation and storage, a kind of subversion of the natural entropic decay in order to generate structure. </p>
    <p>Genotypic and Phenotypic biological processes can be represented as autopoietic systems, which must a) constantly recreate themselves (to counteract decay), b) protect themselves from their environment (to avoid loss of identity), and c) take resources from and pass waste to the environment (to achieve a) and b)). The maintenance of identity is not perfect however, and through slight variation evolution can become possible.</p>
    <p>Evolution itself demands two systemic elements: a heterogenous 'search space' of genetic possibilities, and a sorting mechanism (the 'fitness function') to filter this space by incremental variation. The fitness function is in part derived from organisms' abilities to extract and store matter-energy from the field (landscape, weather, etc), and in part derived from their abilities to compete and collaborate with other organisms and species. Crucial to the holistic system view is that evolution proceeds in a coherent adaptive landscape; that the biological changes in the system can feed back and transform the environment of each species. Hence our interest to also extend feedback to the geographical strata.</p>
    <p>Finally we wish to add to this system a aymbolic component, a sonic rather than visual strata, in the form of communication between organisms. The temporal structure of sonic units and their relationships are to be understood as the semantic content, which is dynamically and ecologically derived. We may grant such communication power in order to expand (or contract) organism behavior, and perhaps also influence genetic processes as a novel experiment.</p>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Conservation of matter-energy<br>
        </li>
      <li>Entropic loss of matter-energy/information in every transaction<br>
        </li>
      <li>Sun as continuous input of energy (far from equilibrium)<br>
        </li>
      <li>Geographical strata as a field of matter-energy<br>
        </li>
      <li>Biological strata diverts (transformation and storage) the path from input to decay<br>
        </li>
      <li>Biological units (cells, organisms) as autopoietic processes<br>
        </li>
      <li>Evolution &amp; speciation in an adaptive landscape<br>
        </li>
      <li>Symbolic communication between organisms, influencing future actions</li>
      </ul>
    <h4>Composition as play between growth and decay  </h4>
    <p>The source of energy finding a path to decay immediately calls to mind the excitation and resonance model of sonic production (or indeed Wishart's distinction of imposed gesture and implicit behavior of sound). The biological diversion of this flow into more complex structures calls to mind Herbert Brun's notion of information and decay in music.</p>
    <p>Most digital models of sound do not exist in a decaying medium, so it will be our experiment to implement a naturally entropic audio system in which music must be autopoietic to persist and evolve. Sonic material will be processed by nodes of transformation and delay, but nodes themselves must be fed input (of the appropriate types) in order to maintain themselves.</p>
    <p><img src="img/drawinghands.jpg" width="143" height="119" align="right">Evolution and the adaptive landscape meanwhile suggest strange loops as sources of complexity, which can be compared to generative composition systems (including chaos, fractals, etc.) Meanwhile the memetic component implies more statistical and sequential generative discrete structures such as Markov chains, boolean networks, neural nets. The feedback layers imply some kind of adaptive analysis.</p>
    <p>Essential to the model is a notion of directed (irreversible, Bergsonian) time. This irreversibility is seen as the source of creativity, in evolution, nonlinear complexity, generation of hierarchy and self-organization, and so on. Therefore also essential to the model is that different forms of matter-energy behave at different rates, mapping back into the multi-scale notion of musical organization. Such notions emphasize duration as a thing-lived, and the irreversibility of processes (and thus are applicable from information theory, dissipative media and complex dynamics through music, animation and so on to consciousness). </p>
