We decided to make a structure that would								react to the emotions of a person.  The structure is								like an animal that changes form based on emotion.  The								person is the source of the emotion; she is the "heart"								of the animal, and is physically inside the structure								communicating her emotions to the outside world.							</p>						</td>					</tr>				</table>        </div>	</div></body></html>
